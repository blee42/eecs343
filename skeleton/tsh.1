.SH SYNOPSIS
tsh \- [command] [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsh
is a shell command line interpreter for Unix systems.  The shell handles the execution of commands inputted by the user with a number of optional arguments.  The program takes care of job control, including running jobs in both the foreground and background, some builtin commands, and a couple of different signals.
